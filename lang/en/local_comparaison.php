<h1>Bulk enrolments</h1>

<p>
With this option you are going to enrol a list of known users from a file with one account per line
</p>
<p>
<b> The firstline </b> the empty lines or unknown accounts will be skipped. </p>

<p>
The file may contains one or two columns, separated by a comma, a semi-column or a tabulation.

You should prepare it from your usual spreadsheet program from official lists of students, for example,
and add if needed a column with groups to which you want these users to be added. Finally export it as CSV. (*)</p>

<p>
<b> The first one must contains a unique account identifier </b>: idnumber (by default) login or email  of the target user. (**). </p>

<p>
The second <b>if present,</b> contains the group's name in wich you want that user to be added. </p>

<p>
If the group name does not exist, it will be created in your course, together with a grouping of the same name to which the group will be added.
.<br/>
This is due to the fact that in Moodle, activities can be restricted to groupings (group of groups), not groups,
 so it will make your life easier. (this requires that groupings are enabled by your site administrator).

<p>
You may have in the same file different target groups or no groups for some accounts
</p>

<p>
You may unselect options to create groups and groupings if you are sure that they already exist in the course.
</p>

<p>
By default the users will be enroled as students but you may select other roles that you are allowed to manage (teacher, non editing teacher
or any custom roles)
</p>

<p>
You may repeat this operation at will without dammages, for example if you forgot or mispelled the target group.
</p>
